    <h1>Mike Gottschalk</h1>
        <p><em>Accessibility Specialist</em></p>
        <p>Experienced Content Specialist with a demonstrated success working in education, from the middle school level to college. Skilled in Microsoft Word, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe Photoshop, Vector Illustration, and Web Accessibility. Strong communicator with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) focused in Political Science and Government from University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I'm passionate about many things—from art and literature to technology and education—but making the web accessible for everyone is where my passions and work skills meet.</p>

        <p>My greatest strength is my ability to make the complex world of web accessibility easy to understand for people with limited knowledge of the laws and technology that inform it. My past as an educator has made me an adept trainer and resource for all things accessibility, including ADA compliance and WCAG conformance. I pride myself on my ability to learn quickly and make complex topics approachable. I'm always available to help, as the work of web accessibility is never complete and I love the challenge.</p>
